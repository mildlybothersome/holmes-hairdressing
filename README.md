## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a 3-page responsive website for the independent
hairdressers, Holmes Hairdressing.
The target audience are predominantly females in the South Staffordshire area aged
25+ that currently don’t follow the hairdresser on social media.

## Client Goals
+ Attract new customers by improving SEO
+ Promote personal branding
+ Promote social media pages
+ Increase social media followers
+ Ensure users know how to contact to book an appointment

## User Goals
+ Find out about the hairdresser and whether their location is nearby or can accommodate travel.
+ Whether the hairdresser can do the styles that the client is looking for
+ Be able to read testimonials from previous clients
+ An easy way for the client to be able to book or request an appointment

The website will be able to support these goals by:
+ including a map to the salon
+ An about section that features the styles that they excel in
+ A section that features reviews from past clients

+ a gallery to show previous work
+ prices for common treatments
+ a contact page to request appointments
+ links to social media pages.

## Justification
The gallery is a good visual representation of the work they do that goes above and
beyond words from the testimonials and deserves it own dedicated page as there is
a large portfolio of work to choose from. On their social media pages, they often
include before and after photos which would be a good way to split the page on
larger screens with the potential to include a swipe option on mobile devices.

The most common treatments include a dry cut and a cut and finish options as these
are fixed prices. When asked the client stated that additional treatments such as
colours are variable due to the length of time they take as well as the material costs.
Wedding and prom hairstyling is also subject to quotations due to technicality and
travel costs.

The contact page will be linked to the client’s email address for them to contact the
customers later. After speaking with them, the client would prefer this method to a
booking form due to them already having a way to manage their appointments and
converting this to a booking form would cause problems with the existing schedule.

## Design Choices
The site design is to be matched with the existing branding that the client has
already on their social media sites and on their business cards. The following
choices have been made with this in mind:

### Fonts

+ The primary font will be --- as this is the one that is a similar font to the main H on
the client’s business card which serves as the logo and will stand out for headings on
the pages and navbar
+ The secondary font will be --- as this is a similar font to the content posts that the client puts out for information on their website
for content and is more compact than the heading.

### Colours

+ Primary colour choices are sourced from the existing communications sent out by
the client on their social media using a colour picker using image editing software.
This includes a dark silver/grey font/rose gold for
contrast as well as visibility. , 
+ Other colours choices were made at the client’s specification. They requested
colours that contrast well but also fit in with their branding. #bd7777 #a28f91
