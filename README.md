# holmes-hairdressing

Holmes Hairdressing is an independant hairdressing salon and in this project I will be creating a website for them.

The website will be a 3 page responsive site with a mobile focus approach as this is the most used format clients will contact the stylist.
These pages will be a Home page with client testimonials, a Gallery with previous work and a contact page. 
The site will contain colours corresponding to the established brand.

External user’s goal:
 The site's users are potential or current clients of Holmes Hairdressing, who would like to see information about the stylist, previous work and how to contact them.

Site owner's goal:
The stylist is interested in expanding their business and gaining new clients

Potential features to include:
 Showcase photos of previous work and styles.
 Provide detail on how to book an appointment and link to social media.
 Provide information on the salon's location, work schedule and contact details.
